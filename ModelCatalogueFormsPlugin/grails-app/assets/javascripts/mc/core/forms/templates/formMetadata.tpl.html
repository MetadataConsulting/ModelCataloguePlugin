          Defines the name of the CRF as it will be displayed in the OpenClinica user interface. Defaults to model's name. When a user is assigning CRFs to an event definition, they will be viewing this name. A user performing data entry will identify the form by this name. Can contain up to 255 alphanumeric characters.

          Defines the version of the CRF as it will be displayed in the OpenClinica user interface. Defaults to model version number.

          You cannot provide a value that has already been used in the OpenClinica instance unless it has not been assigned
          to an event definition yet.  If a particular CRF version has not been used in an event definition, you may
          overwrite it.

          If this is a new version of a CRF that already exists, the CRF_NAME field must match the value of the form
          already in OpenClinica.

          A new version of a CRF would be needed due to a protocol change, adding or removing an item from a CRF, or
          changing some of the questions.

          Can contain up to 255 alphanumeric characters.

          If this is the first version of the CRF, you can simply state this is a brand new form.  Going forward, as you make changes and update the versions you can provide information on what is different between the first version and each subsequent version.
