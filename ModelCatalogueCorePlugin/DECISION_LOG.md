`EnumeratedTypeMarshaller` does not extend `DataTypeMarshaller` directly because if so we got into infinite loop
thanks to current Groovy language bug. Calling `super.prepareJsonMap(element)` is calling itself causing stack
overflow when initiated from `EnumeratedTypeMarshaller.prepareJsonMap(element)`.

Classifies is now modeled again as `Relationship` between `Classification` and `PublishedElement`. Grails simply doesn't
handle complicated many-to-many mappings gracefully.

Reverted test configuration to not-forked because current `code-coverage` plugin does not support forked mode.
