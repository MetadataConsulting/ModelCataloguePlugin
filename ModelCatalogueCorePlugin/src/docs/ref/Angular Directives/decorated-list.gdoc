h1. decorated-list

Generic element directive for showing items enhanced by [list|Angular Enhancers] enhancer. Default template defined in
@mc.core.ui.bs.decoratedListTable@ is showing each item of the list as table row with pagination at the bottom of the table.
The directive accepts three two-ways bound attributes @list@, @columns@ and @selection@. Only the @list@ attribute is mandatory and
represents the list structure which should match the expected input

{code}
{
      list: [],
      next: function(){...},
      previous: function(){...},
      goto: function(page) {...},
      total: 12,
      offset: 10,
      size: 2,
      page: 10,
      itemType: 'com.example.Type'
}
{code}

@columns@ defines which columns should be present in the table in an array of following structures:

{note}
Instead of managing the columns definition in your business code, you should use [columns|Angular Services] service
to manage columns definition in one place.
{note}

{table}
Key     | Value
header  | string to be rendered in the table's header row
value   | value to be shown defined either as function called with current row item as single parameter or string expression which is evaluated in the context of current row element
classes | classes to be added to value cell defined either as function called with current row item as single parameter or object declaring the classes and it's condition expressions
show    | recipe how to show the item in the row if possible, either @true@ which is equivalent to @show()@ or function called with current row item as single parameter on click or string expression which is evaluated in the context of current row element and should perform the show action
{table}


If @selection@ attribute is present the table will show the selection check boxes in the first column and the @selection@
value is populated with the items from the checked rows.

h2. Usage

Considering you have following code in you controller with injected [catalogueElementResource|Angular Services],
[columns|Angular Services] and [enhance|Angular Services] services:

{code}
var itemType = 'com.modelcatalogue.core.ValueDomain'
// first declare an empty list before the values are loaded
$scope.list     = enhance.getEnhancer('list').createEmptyList(type)
// also get the appropriate columns definitions
$scope.columns  = columns(type)
catalogueElementResource('valueDomain').list().then(function(list) {
    $scope.list = list;
});
{code}

And following HTML snippet in your page:
{code}
<decorated-list list="list" columns="columns"></decorated-list>
{code}

Than you get first ten value domain objects rendered in the table with pagination using the default columns definitions.

h2. Customization
You can override the @modelcatalogue/core/ui/decoratedList.html@ template to plug your own either using
@text/ng-template@ script definition, creating the template on the appropriate location in your server
or using the [$templateCache|http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$templateCache].

Following variables and methods are added by the directive controller (besides @list@, @columns@ and @selection@):

{table}
Name                            | Description
hasSelection()                  | Returns @true@ if selecting rows is enabled for this directive
allSelected                     | Is set to @true@ if all the rows should be selected
updateSelectAll(val)            | Sets the new value for @allSelected@ variable and updates the @selection@ appropriately
updateSelection()               | Updates the @selection@ appropriately
goto(page)                      | Goes to page of given number
hasNext()                       | Weather there is yet another page of items available
next()                          | Proceeds to the next page
hasPrevious()                   | Weather there is yet another page of items available before current one
previous()                      | Proceeds to the previous page
showEnabled(showDefinition)     | Check if the value supports showing itself
evaluateValue(value, item)      | Evaluates the value using the value definition from the columns and the item
evaluateClasses(value, item)    | Evaluates the classes using the value and the item
showItem(value, item)           | Shows the item if possible
