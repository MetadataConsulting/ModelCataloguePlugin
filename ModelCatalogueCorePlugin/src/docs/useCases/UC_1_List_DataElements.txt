Postconditions: None

Main
Success Scenario: 
1. User select list data elements from the menu
2. System displays list of data elements
3. User clicks on the filter by model button (i.e. in the column header)
4. User is presented with a popup with a list of models to filter on 
5. User chooses the model to filter by (hepatitis)
6. System displays a list of the data elements included in the hepatitis model (including: name, description, link)

Extensions: 	
2a. No data elements are displayed
â€” 2a1. System displays error message saying there are no data elements available.
4a. No models are included in the filter list
- 4a1 the filter by model button will return an error saying there are no models to filter on
4b. User searches for the models rather than simply selecting them (i.e. there maybe many models to filter on)
- 4b1 the list of models will return the models that match the search query
5a. User selects multiple models to filter on
- 5a1 the data elements will be filtered by multiple models

N.B. Filters should be "saved". i.e. if a user navigates to a particular dataElement and returns to the page they would expect the list would have the same filter in place
