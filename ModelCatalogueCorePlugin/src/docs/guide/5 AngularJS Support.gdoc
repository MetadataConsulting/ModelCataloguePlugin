h2. Introduction

This plugin provides set of AngularJS directives and services for easier work with the API on the front-end side. See
Angular related topics in the Quick Reference panel on the right side.

h2. Including AngularJS services and directives in you application

If you use asset pipeline plugin, your application main script should require following assets

{code}
//= require jquery/dist/jquery
//= require bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap
//= require angular/angular
//= require modelcatalogue/util/index
//= require modelcatalogue/core/index
//= require modelcatalogue/core/ui/index
//= require modelcatalogue/core/ui/bs/index
{code}

h2. Configuration

You should configure the [modelCatalogueApiRoot|Angular Values] on each page where you want to take advantage of
the AngularJS support.

{code:html}
<script type="text/javascript">
    angular
    .module('demo.config', ['mc.core.modelCatalogueApiRoot'])
    .value('modelCatalogueApiRoot', '${request.contextPath ?: ''}/api/modelCatalogue/core');
</script>
{code}

When catalogue element is requested to be shown, [showCatalogueElement|Angular Events] is broadcast. You should
respond to that event accordingly showing the request catalogue element e.g. by changing the current location hash.

{code}
$scope.on('showCatalogueElement', function(event, element) {
    // display the element by e.g. changing the current route
})
{code}

h2. AngularJS Services

There is several services provided out of the box for this plugin. The most important services are [modelCatalogueSearch|Angular Services]
and [catalogueElementResource|Angular Services].

Considering you have injected these two services into your controller you can write code like following one:

{code}
var valueDomains = catalogueElementResource('valueDomain')
valueDomains.list().then(function(list) {
    $scope.list = list;
});
valueDomain.get(15).then(function(element) {
    $scope.element = element
});

// or
modelCatalogueSearch('patient').then(function(list) {
   $scope.list = list;
});
{code}

h2. AngularJS Directives

A few directives are provides as well. The most important one is [catalogue-element-view|Angular Directives]
which simply takes the catalogue element and displays it in convenient way.

{code}
 <catalogue-element-view element="element"></catalogue-element-view>
{code}

For displaying list responses [decorated-list|Angular Directives] directive is very useful. It takes the lists
passed by methods from [modelCatalogueSearch|Angular Services] and [catalogueElementResource|Angular Services]
and shows them in paginated table.
{code}
<decorated-list list="list"></decorated-list>
{code}
