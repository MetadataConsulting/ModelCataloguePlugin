There exist several stories on the exact original definition of his scale; however, some of the specifics have been presumed lost or exaggerated with time. The scale is now usually defined by two fixed points: the temperature at which water freezes into ice is defined as 32 degrees, and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212 degrees, a 180 degree separation, as defined at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure.","version":0,"elementType":"org.modelcatalogue.core.MeasurementUnit","elementTypeName":"Measurement Unit","link":"/measurementUnit/58","outgoingRelationships":{"count":0,"itemType":"org.modelcatalogue.core.Relationship","link":"/measurementUnit/58/outgoing"},"incomingRelationships":{"count":0,"itemType":"org.modelcatalogue.core.Relationship","link":"/measurementUnit/58/incoming"},"symbol":"°F"},"rule":null,"dataType":{"id":57,"name":"double","description":"a double","version":1,"elementType":"org.modelcatalogue.core.DataType","elementTypeName":"Data Type","link":"/dataType/57","outgoingRelationships":{"count":0,"itemType":"org.modelcatalogue.core.Relationship","link":"/dataType/57/outgoing"},"incomingRelationships":{"count":0,"itemType":"org.modelcatalogue.core.Relationship","link":"/dataType/57/incoming"},"valueDomains":{"count":1,"itemType":"org.modelcatalogue.core.ValueDomain","link":"/dataType/57/valueDomain"}},"mappings":{"count":0,"itemType":"org.modelcatalogue.core.Mapping","link":"/valueDomain/73/mapping"}}
