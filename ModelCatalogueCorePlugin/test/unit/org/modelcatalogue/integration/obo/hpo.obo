Alternatively, the urethra may be an open groove along the dorsal shaft of the penis, with no readily recognized meatus.

comment: Note that this term can include or combine variations in size and shape, with partial or complete absence of structures. It is preferable to describe the individual components, which are defined below. It is nonetheless a widely used bundled term and as such is retained here. The distinction of this finding from a marked degree of Hypospadias is an example of how this term can be problematic. Genetic gender is determined at fertilization, whereby the presence of a Y chromosome determines male gender. Normally, genetic gender determines gonadal gender which in turn determines phenotypic gender. Testicular development is an active process requiring expression of the primary testis determining gene SRY, which is located on the Y chromosome.

def: "The presence of multiple cysts in both kidneys." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Most commonly, PKD arises as an inherited trait. Tremendous enlargement of both kidneys is characteristic of the autosomal dominant form of PKD, with up to hundreds or thousands of renal cysts. This term does not refer to the disease entity but rather to the finding of numerous cysts in both kidneys.

comment: A urine potassium assay can be used to determine the cause of reduced serum potassium (hypokalemia). Normally, the kidney will reabsorb more potassium in the presence of hypokalemia. Therefore, a low urine potassium can suggest gastrointestinal potassium loss, poor dietary intake, or a shift of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space. On the other hand, a high urine potassium in the face of low serum potassium indicated renal loss, referred to as renal potassium wasting.

comment: Palatal width is measured as the distance between the maxillary first permanent molar on the right and left sides, at the lingual cervical line, using a specific device. Palate width is typically assessed subjectively in routine clinical practice. Narrowing is often associated with a High palate, but this should be assessed and coded separately. Gingival overgrowth can give the impression of a narrow palate but should be distinguished and coded separately. The term gothic palate is used to indicate that the roof of the palate is not round but rather has an inverted V-shape, and therefore, only the upper part of the palate is narrow.

comment: Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981], but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively or use the Likert scale for Caucasians and African Americans [Astley and Clarren, 2000]. The height of the vermilion of the upper lip varies among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. The thinness of the upper lip vermilion is sensitive to facial expression. On profile view, a thin vermilion is less convex than usual. A thin upper lip vermilion may be associated with a smooth philtrum and an absence of the Cupid's bow, but these should be assessed separately.

comment: Turricephaly is derived from the Latin word turris, meaning tall, and refers to a round, tall (tower-like) skull. This feature may have previously been considered to overlap with or include a tall forehead. Turricephaly is present when the head appears tall (subjective) and head length and width are reduced compared to normal age-related standards (objective). Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. The term acrocephaly (or oxycephaly) is used when there is turricephaly and the top of the skull assumes a cone shape.

Scaphocephaly is a subtype of dolichocephaly where the anterior and posterior aspects of the cranial vault are pointed (boat-shaped).

comment: Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

name: Lop ear
def: "Anterior and inferior folding of the upper portion of the ear that obliterates triangular fossa and scapha." [HPO:probinson, pmid:19152421]
comment: The term 'lop ear' refers to excessive protrusion of the ear from the side of the head, that is, the external ear stands away from the head at a greater than normal angle (Normal angle of the auricle to the median plane averages 25 degrees in boys and 18 degrees in girls). Lop ears are usually larger than normal ears. Mild forms are limited to the superior ear, more severe forms affect the superior and posterior ear. The concha may be excessively concave. This should be distinguished from an Overfolded helix where the external contour of the ear is normal.

The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.

def: "An abnormality of eye movement characterized by impaired smooth-pursuit eye movements." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Tracking eye movements consist of two different components, namely, smooth pursuit and saccades. Smooth pursuit, or just pursuit, is a class of rather slow eye movements that minimizes retinal target motion. Saccades are rapid eye movements that align the fovea with the target. Slow-pursuit eye movements are involved in tracking a slowly moving target after the saccadic system has placed the image of the target on the fovea.

comment: Various scales have been developed to describe the extent of vision loss and define blindness. Total blindness is the complete lack of form and visual light perception and is clinically recorded as NLP (no light perception). Blindness is frequently used to describe severe visual impairment with residual vision. Those described as having only light perception have no more sight than the ability to tell light from dark and the general direction of a light source.

def: "A developmental anomaly characterized by a reduced number of teeth, whereby more than 6 teeth are missing." [HPO:curators, pmid:19125428]
comment: The diagnosis of oligodontia requires a radiograph, as is true for anodontia and for the other designation of tooth agenesis, hypodontia. The terms hypodontia and oligodontia are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature while on other occasions hypodontia is used for selective agenesis of six or less missing teeth while oligodontia is applied when there are more than six missing teeth. Tooth agenesis or oligodontia/hypodontia can be mistaken for delayed eruption and again a radiograph is needed for diagnosis. Absence of teeth may be congenital (tooth agenesis) or acquired. The incidence of congenital absence of teeth is different depending on the type and position of the tooth [Gorlin et al, 2001].

comment: Standard reference has means and standard deviations by gender [Moyers et al, 1976]. It is easy to measure the width of teeth, for which reason the definition of microdontia can be made with reference to the width of the tooth. However, microdontia means that the overall size of the tooth is decreased. In microdontia, the gaps between the teeth, particularly the anterior upper and lower teeth, are increased, creating diastemata. This should be assessed and coded separately.

Both angiotensin I and II are vasoconstrictors. Angiotensin II additionally leads to the production of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, which in turn leads to an increase in blood volume.

comment: Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs most commonly secondary to chronic renal failure. Other causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism include osteomalacia, rickets, and malabsorption. The pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism results from abnormalities in the renal tubular absorption of phosphate with reduced phosphate excretion and hyperphosphatemia, as well as impaired renal conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferal to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which in turn leads to a decrease in the intestinal absorption of calcium. In combination, elevated serum phosphate levels and reduced vitamin D production result in decreases in serum calcium levels or hypocalcemia, leading to hyperparathyroidism.

In persons with polydactyly that includes a supernumerary metacarpal, that should be separately coded and the measurement technique from Hall et al, [2007] would need to be modified to account for the supernumerary digit (i.e., with postaxial polydactyly, measure to the sixth MCPJ).

comment: Hand clenching is commonly characterized by malpositioning of the fingers characterized by radial deviation of the 4th and 5th digits and ulnar deviation of the 2nd digit over the 3rd finger. Hand clenching is distinguished from Camptodactyly, as that term may describe fewer than five digits of a eudactylous hand and does not involve the MCPJ. The digits may overlap when they lie flexed in the palm. It is not necessary to specify the overlapping fingers finding separately.

comment: The reduced soft tissue is typically abductor pollicis brevis and flexor pollicis brevis muscle bulk. Detection of this abnormality entails clinical judgment, especially in mild cases. The bulk of the muscle mass around the base of the thumb is diminished, and there may be a mild concavity over the volar aspect of the first metacarpal. When the deficiency is unilateral, comparison between the two hands will point up the often-subtle change in contour of the thenar muscles. If the degree of involvement is severe, the palm may taper in width proximally.

def: "A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age." [DDD:hvfirth, HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.

def: "Reduced strength of muscles." [HPO:probinson, pmid:15832536]
comment: It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.

comment: Note that the girth may be increased in a broad finger, but this must be distinguished from Macrodactyly, because there the length is also increased. This distinction can be subtle. This term should not be used when the increased width is limited to the distal phalanges, instead use Broad fingertips. The affected digit should be specified by the numbering scheme in the introduction. This term is not used for the first digit, see Broad thumbs. When a thumb and one or more fingers are affected, it may be more economical to specify "Broad fingers, F1-5" instead of separately specifying "Broad thumb" and "Broad fingers F2-5".

Based on these definitions, macrosomia affects 1-10% of all pregnancies. A diagnosis of fetal macrosomia can be made only by measuring birth weight after delivery; therefore, the condition is confirmed only retrospectively, ie, after delivery of the neonate.

comment: Infundibular pulmonic stenosis is mostly caused by overgrowth of the heart muscle wall (hypertrophy of the septoparietal trabeculae). Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis. The degree of stenosis varies between individuals with TOF, and is the primary determinant of symptoms and severity. This malformation is infrequently described as sub-pulmonary stenosis or subpulmonary obstruction.

def: "Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a type of ventriculoarterial connection in which both great vessels arise entirely or predominantly from the right ventricle." [HPO:probinson, pmid:10798433]
comment: During the development of the heart, the outflow tract initially connects exclusively with the primitive right ventricle and must undergo extensive remodelling to divide into a separate pulmonary artery and aorta; subsequently, there is continued remodelling to establish direct continuity from the left ventricle to the aorta. DORV encompasses a wide spectrum of anatomic arrangements and pathophysiologic disturbances. At one end of the spectrum, it mimics tetralogy of Fallot in the presence of pulmonary stenosis, or a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the absence of such stenosis. At the other end of the spectrum, it behaves like transposition of the great arteries with a VSD.

[HPO:probinson, pmid:17916581]

comment: The vestibular apparatus is the nonauditory portion of the inner ear that mediates the subjective sensation of motion and spatial orientation of the head, adjusts muscular activity and body position to maintain posture, and stabilizes in space the fixation point of the eyes when the head moves, in order to provide a stable image upon the retina. The functioning of the vestibular system is often checked clinically by means of the caloric test, in which the head is tilted backward by about 60 degrees and either warm or cold water is introduced into the external auditory meatus on one side. The immediate results are usually vertigo, nausea, nystagmus, and twisting of the head and body.

comment: No objective standard for nail thickness could be identified. An unsupported claim suggests that nails are 0.5 mm in females and 0.6 mm in males. Thin nails are usually brittle, may easily fray, or break at the free edge. Thin nails usually grow slowly but this definition does not require slow growth of the nail. Note that the term koilonychia is an abnormal shape of the fingernail where the nail has raised ridges and is thin and concave. Since it indicates also other characteristics than thin nails, it should not be used to indicate this. The affected digits should be specified.

comment: Congenital vertical talus is characterized by pes valgus, a rigid flatfoot deformity (as opposed to a flexible calcaneovalgus foot) caused by a malpositioned navicular bone at the neck of the talus; the ankle is in severe equinus and the forefoot in dorsiflexion, rocker bottom-like, accompanied by contraction of the talonavicular, deltoid and calcaneal cuboidal ligaments. The foot examination usually reveals a rigid foot with a "reversed" arch, a convex plantar surface, and a deep crease on the lateral dorsal side of the foot. The ankle joint is plantarflexed, while the midfoot and forefoot are extended upward. Lateral foot radiographs are helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

comment: Metatarsus varus (adductus) is one of the most common foot deformities, that is defined as a transverse plane deformity in Lisfranc's (tarsometatarsal) joints in which the metatarsals are deviated medially. The relationship between talus and calcaneus is normal. On inspection the toes angle abruptly towards the midline, creating a C-shaped lateral foot border with a prominent styloid process of the 5th metatarsal. The result is that the forefoot is twisted inwards relative to the heel, so that the sole faces the midline.

A partial duplication can present itself on x-rays as a notched phalanx, bifid phalanx or a broadened phalanx. Polydactyly affecting the big toe is called preaxial or hallucal polydactyly of the feet.

comment: This term differs from Partial absence of the toe because in that term the phalanx must be missing, whereas here it may be small, but present. Relative shortening of the distal phalanges of the toes can be harder to assess than in the fingers, as they are normally quite short. Distal phalangeal lengths can be assessed subjectively by comparing that digit segment to the rest of the digit, to other normal digits in that patient, or to typical patients of that age or build.

comment: Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.

def: "A decreased concentration of glucose in the blood associated with a reduced concentration of ketone bodies." [HPO:probinson]
comment: MERGED COMMENT:\nTARGET COMMENT: Normally, decreased glucose production leads to increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and the production of ketones.  Thus, ketones provide an indication of whether the hypoglycemia is a result of inadequate production or overutilization of glucose (which tends to be associated with low plasma ketone levels). Hypoketotic hypoglycemia developing within several minutes of feeding is typical of hyperinsulinism.\n--------------------\nSOURCE COMMENT: A good starting point for evaluating hypoglycemia is to divide patients into ketotic or non-ketotic.  Normal physiologic response to decreased glucose production is increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and the production of ketones.  Ketones provide an indirect indication of whether hypoglycemia is the result of inadequate production or of over-utilization of glucose (insulin-induced over-utilization, associated with low urine or plasma ketones).  The history of the relationship of the hypoglycemia to feeding is often helpful. Hypoketotic hypoglycemia developing within several minutes of feeding is typical of hyperinsulinism.  Patients with defects in glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, or fatty acid oxidation tend to tolerate short-term fasting much better.

This term does not describe the disease entity, but rather the finding of an increased concentration of homocystine in urine, which can be easily detected by a sensitive test for disulphide compounds (the cyanide-nitroprusside reaction) and using chromatographic techniques. Homocystinuria can be caused by biochemical defects including cystathionine B-synthase deficiency, N5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocystine methyltransferase deficiency, N5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and methhylcobalamin deficiency.

def: "Gray matter heterotopia is a neurological disorder caused by clumps of grey matter being located in the wrong part of the brain. It is characterized as a type of cortical malformation. The neurons in heterotopia may appear to be normal, except for their mislocation; nuclear studies have shown glucose metabolism equal to that of normally positioned gray matter. The condition causes a variety of symptoms, but usually includes some degree of epilepsy or recurring seizures, and often affects the brain's ability to function on higher levels. Symptoms range from nonexistent to profound, in which case heterotopia can result in severe seizure disorder, loss of motor skills, and mental retardation." [DDD:ssisodiya, HPO:curators]

comment: Patients often describe myotonia as stiffness that is worse at the onset of activity and that improves with repeated muscle contractions. Myotonia tends to worsen in cold weather. Myotonia can be elicited by voluntary muscle contraction of by muscle percussion (e.g., by tapping the thenar eminence). During physical examination, myotonia may be elicited by asking the patient to make a tight fist and then quickly open the hand. Myotonia is caused by an abnormality in the muscle membrane, i.e., of the ion channels that control the contraction of muscle fibers.

comment: A functional deficit of the tract that conveys nervous impulses from the motor cortex of the brain to the spinal cord. The corticospinal tract mediates discrete voluntary skilled movements. Clinical features of corticospinal tract dysfunction may include spasticity and weakness, particularly affecting the lower limbs, as well as hyperreflexia, clonus at the ankles and knees, and extensor plantar responses (Babinski response).

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation.

def: "A developmental malformation of the occipital bone and upper end of the cervical spine, in which the latter appears to have pushed the floor of the occipital bone upward such that there is an  abnormal flattening of the skull base." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Platybasia is malformation of the base of the skull due to softening of skull bones or a developmental anomaly, with bulging upwards of the floor of the posterior cranial fossa, upward displacement of the upper cervical vertebrae, and bony impingement on the brainstem. It results in abnormal obtuseness of the basal angle that can be demonstrated radiographically. If platybasia is associated with basilar invagination, compression of the brainstem and upper cervical cord can result.

AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase 'arthrogryposis multiplex congenita' as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1). This term refers to the finding of multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth rather than to the disease entities of which this is a clinical feature.

def: "An impairment of the class-switch recombination process that normally leads B lymphocytes to produce IgG, IgA, or IgE." [HPO:probinson, pmid:11544001]
comment: The generation of the antibody repertoire requires two successive steps. The first is antigen- and T-cell-independent; it takes place in the fetal liver and the bone marrow. Immature B lymphocytes rearrange their immunoglobulin-gene variable segments (V segments), diversity segments (D segments) and joining segments (J segments), producing a functionally integrated VDJ segment linked to the mu constant region (C-mu), which determines the primary antibody repertoire composed of IgM antibodies. The second step is antigen- and T-cell-dependent and takes place in secondary lymphoid organs. After encountering antigen, B cells proliferate and form germinal centers. In this unique anatomic formation, two genetic events lead to generation of the secondary antibody repertoire: class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). CSR of immunoglobulins occurs by a recombination process between two different switch regions (S regions) located upstream of each C region. Replacement of C-mu by a constant region of another class of immunoglobulin (C-gamma, C-alpha or C-epsilon) ensues and leads to the production of IgG, IgA or IgE.

comment: The bleeding time test measures the time taken for blood vessel constriction and platelet plug formation to occur. No clot is allowed to form, so that the arrest of bleeding depends exclusively on blood vessel constriction and platelet action. To perform the test, pressure is maintained throughout the test by inflating a sphygmomanometer cuff on the upper arm. The dorsal surface of the forearm is then cleaned, and the bleeding time device placed onto the skin  and the trigger is depressed. At 30-second intervals, the flow of blood is blotted with filter paper. The time from puncture to cessation of bleeding is then recorded as the bleeding time. Normal values depend on the device used and other parameters, but are around 2 to 9 minutes.

Myelination, i.e., the presence of a segmented lipid-rich sheath (myelin), enables faster and more energetically efficient conduction of electrical impulses. The sheath is formed by the cell membranes of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (GO:0022011).

comment: A  nerve conduction study (NCS) is commonly conducted together with electromyography in order to evaluate muscle disorders. For the NCS, dermal electrodes are placed at intervals over the nerve to be examined, and a low-intensity current is introducted to generate action potentials. The velocity of the action potential is related to the diameter of the nerve fiber and the presence of a myelin sheath. Diseases of the myelin sheath characteristically reduce the nerve conduction velocity (NCV). The amplitude of the response is also measured.

Note that individuals may be described as having a cleft ala nasi, but have a severely Underdeveloped ala nasi. In an underdeveloped ala the continuity of the tissue encircling the nostril is undisturbed while in a cleft it is disrupted.

comment: Accumulation of intracellular autofluorescent material or aging pigment has been characterized as a normal aging event. Lipofuscin (from the Greek word for fat and the Latin word for dark), refers to intracellular autofluorescent material that accumulates in aging cells with a excitation wavelength between 320 and 480 nm and an emission wavelength between 460 and 630 nm. Lpofuscin consists of a mixture of oxidized proteins and lipids, carbohydrates and trace amount of metals. Ceroid iss a lipofuscin-like lipopigment that arises from pathological conditions such as disease, malnutrition, and cell stress. Subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase makes up approximately 40% of this lipopigment/ceroid accumulation.

def: "An abnormality related to a defect of vertebral separation during development." [HPO:probinson, pmid:23653580, pmid:23801490]
comment: The vertebral column derives from somites, transient paired segments of mesoderm that surround the neural tube in the early embryo. The formation of the vertebrar involves many processes including resegmentation of the rostral and caudal regions of adjacent somites that then fuse to form vetebral elements. Disruption of these processes can a cause of severe segmentation defects of the vetebrae. The frequency of segmentation defects of the vetebra has been estimated at 0.5 of 1000 births. The range of segmentation defects includes left-right uneven formation of somites that results in hemivertebrae or wedge vertebrae. Incomplete segmentation can result in fused segments such as block vertebrae. A failure of the process of resegmentation and migration of the sclerotomal compartment can result in a failure of midline fusion, such as butterlfy vertebrae.

Over 120 different fragile sites have been identified in the human genome. Some of these sites are sensitive to folate, that is, they can be induced by a culture medium deficient in folic acid and thymidine, and hence a medium with lowered levels of dTTP or dCTP, two immediate components of DNA, or by a medium enriched either in methotrexate, an inhibitor of folate metabolism, or in fluorodeoxyuridine, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthesis.

[HPO:probinson]
comment: Regitine produces an alpha-adrenergic block of relatively short duration. In the regitine blocking test, regitine is injected rapidly and bood pressure is recorded immediately after injection, at 30-second intervals for the first 3 minutes, and at 60-second intervals for the next 7 minutes. A positive response to the reginitine blocking test is present when the blood pressure is reduced more than 35 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A typical positive response is a reduction in pressure of 60 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A positive response is suggestive of pheochromocytoma and should generally be confirmed by other diagnostic procedures such as measurement of urinary catecholamines or their metabolites.

Cultured fibroblasts from homozygotes -and heterozygotes for the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses accumulate excessive quantities of glycosaminoglycans.

def: "A premature fusion of the epiphyseal plates of the radius. Epiphyseal plates are located at the distal and proximal ends of the long bones, in this case of the radius and premature fusion will have an effect on the growh of the radial bone, inhibiting or at least disturbing the normal growth and development of the bone." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: The epiphyseal plate (or epiphysial plate, physis, or growth plate) is a hyaline cartilage plate in the metaphysis at each end of a long bone. The plate is found in children and adolescents; in adults, who have stopped growing, the plate is replaced by an epiphyseal line. The growth plate has a very specific morphology in having a zonal arrangement. The growth plate includes a relatively inactive reserve zone at the epiphyseal end, moving distally into a proliferative and then hyper trophic zone and ending with a band of ossifying cartilage (the metaphysis).

The increased girth is accompanied by an increase in the dorso-ventral dimension AND the lateral dimension of the digit." [pmid:19125433]
comment: There are no recognized standards for the girth of digits and this finding can vary substantially in the population. This assessment relies on the judgment of the examiner to recognize when the difference between the expected and the observed is significant. The affected digits should be specified. The definition does not mandate the component of the increased size (bone, connective tissue, etc.), but should exclude edema. The requirement that the girth is most, or all, of the digit is intended to distinguish this from broad fingertips. This should be distinguished from Broad fingers or Broad fingertips as the girth is circumferential in macrodactyly, which is not the case for broad fingers or broad fingertips, which are increased only (or predominantly) in their lateral (A/P) width.

comment: This term refers to a developmental finding resulting in short palms. This term is reserved for individuals with shortening of all four metacarpals 2-5. Individuals with fewer than four shortened metacarpals (in a eudactylous hand, the metacarpals of F2-5) should be coded as Metacarpal, short. See the entry for Hand, small for a discussion of this finding. "Short hand" should not be used as it is a bundle of two readily separable terms, Fingers, short (which, as noted above, can itself be a bundled term) and Palm, short.

def: "For children from birth to 4 years of age, the palm width is more than 2 SD below the mean; for children from 4 to 16 years of age the palm width is below the 5th centile; or, the width of the palm appears disproportionately narrow for its length." [pmid:19125433]
comment: Palm width is measured across the palm at the level of the MCPJ (radial aspect of the F2 MCPJ to the ulnar aspect of the F5 MCPJ). Norms are specified in [Hall et al., 2007]. Caution is advised for the subjective assessment as the breadth may be in the normal range with disproportionately increased length, which appears narrow. This finding may be associated with elongated/slender limbs in general, but that finding does not bear on the coding of this feature. Proximal narrowing may indicate small thenar or hypothenar eminences. This term replaces "narrow hands" as that term may leave the impression that it includes the thumb, which it does not.

The overall amount of mineralization of the bone-organ can be measured as the amount of matter per cubic centimeter of bones, usually measured by densitometry of the lumbar spine or hip. The measurements are usually reported as g/cm3 or as a Z-score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and sex).

comment: Preauricular cysts and sinuses are ectodermal remnants from an aberrant development of the auditory tubercles, tend to be bilateral and are localized anterior to the tragus of the ear. The preauricular sinus is a benign congenital lesion of the preauricular soft tissue consisting of a blind-ending narrow tube or pit. It is also known as preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst. It can be asymptomatic or present as an infected and discharging sinus. It presents as a small pit adjacent to the external ear usually located at the anterior margin of the ascending limb of the helix. The preauricular sinus is variably also termed a preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst.

Inability to maximally concentrate the urine is related to one or both of two basic tubular defects: 1) a failure of maximal free-water generation by the diluting segment in the ascending limb of Henle's loop; and 2) a failure of the distal tubular epithelium to achieve maximum permeability to water during water deprivation.

comment: The ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is irregularly irregular because of the large number of atrial impulses that transit the atrioventricular node, making the ventricle partially refractory to further impulses. Atrial fibrillation can cause a number of manifestations including excessive ventricular response with angina pectoris or hypotension in susceptible individuals, syncope, systemic embolization, fatigue, or anxiety. These features should be coded separately.

comment: DIC is a complex syndrome in which there is pathological generation of thrombin and diffuse intravascular clot formation. DIC may occur as acute decompensated or chronic compensated form. In acute decompensated DIC, there is a sudden massive exposure of tissue factor over a brief time period; Intravascular coagulation can also compromise the blood supply to organs and, in conjunction with hemodynamic and metabolic derangements, may contribute to the failure of multiple organs. At the same time, the use and subsequent depletion of platelets and coagulation proteins resulting from the ongoing coagulation may induce severe bleeding. Chronic DIC, also known as compensated DIC, results from a persistent weak or intermittent activating stimulus. Under such conditions, destruction and production of coagulation factors and platelets are balanced.

[HPO:probinson]
comment: In medical parlance, this is often referred to as Legg Calve Perthes disease. Here, the name 'Avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis' is preferred to emphasize that the term refers to a phenotypic feature rather than a disease entity. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head may result in pain in the hip, limp, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and some degree of atrophy of the affected leg. The phrase Legg Perthes syndrome or Legg Calve Perthes disease is also used to refer to a number of diseases, including the idiopathic form and a form that is related to mutation in the COL2A1 gene (MIM 150600). Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually occurs in boys 4 to 10 years old, and is clinically characterized by limping, hip stiffness, limited range of motion, and can result in restriction of growth of the affected leg and wasting of the muscles of the upper thigh.

comment: On T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, the signal intensity of the normal renal cortex is typically higher than medulla, resulting in easily visualized corticomedullary differentiation (CMD). Loss of CMD can be seen in disorders such as glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, end-stage chronic renal failure, obstructive hydronephrosis, and acute allograft rejection.

comment: The patella initially ossifies at between three and five years, commencing as multiple foci that rapidly coalesce. As the patellar ossification center enlarges the expanding margins may be irregular and associated with accessory ossification centers. These are most common superolaterally and may lead to the development of a bipartite patella. The bipartite patella has cartilaginous continuity despite the appearance of osseous discontinuity. The patella expands to all cartilaginous contours during late adolescence when the epiphyseal ossification centers around the knee are also in the final stages of maturation. The only cartilage not replaced is that occupying the superior two-thirds of the articular surface (the lower one-third is covered by the fat pad). The subchondral plate does not assume the actual articular contours until the late stages of osseous maturation (after ten to twelve years). Accordingly, typical measurements such as medial and lateral angulation cannot be accurately done prior to the final stages of patellar ossification expansion and maturation (pmid:6729496).

comment: During atrioventricular valvuloseptal morphogenesis, the endocardial cushions expand as they are infiltrated by extracellular matrix secreted from the surrounding myocardium. The cushions then fuse and are remodeled to form the atrioventricular valves and septa. Failure of this process results in AVSD, with the degree of severity dependent on the stage at which the developmental failure occurs. AVSD are a spectrum of cardiac malformations that result in a persistent common atrioventricular canal.

This is shed 10-14 days after birth, revealing the main symptom of the disease, extensive scaling of the skin caused by hyperkeratosis. With increasing age, the scaling tends to be concentrated around joints in areas such as the groin, the armpits, the inside of the elbow and the neck.

[HPO:probinson, pmid:17698200]
comment: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is caused by infarction of the laminar or retrolaminar portion of the optic nerve head supplied by the short posterior ciliary arteries. Clinically NAION is characterized by sudden, usually painless, loss of vision in one or both eyes. Examination findings include decreased visual acuity, a visual field defect, decreased colour vision, a relative afferent pupillary defect, and optic disc swelling.

def: "An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization." [HPO:probinson]
comment: The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.

comment: The simultaneous occurrence a low thyroid hormone level and a normal or low serum level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in a patient with hypothyroidism establishes the diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism. The administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which is normally synthesized and released by the hypothalamus, enables the physician to distinguish between pituitary and hypothalamic causes of hypothyroidism.\nTRH will normally cause the release of TSH from the pituitary gland. When the hypothalamus does not synthesize or release TRH, the administration of exogenous TRH will result in prompt rise of serum TSH. To date, the cases reported of pituitary hypothyroidism. Hypothalamic hypothyroidism, on the other hand, may either be idiopathic or result from demonstrable hypothalamic disease.

comment: Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a key hemostatic protein, but documenting its function through laboratory tests is not always straightforward. VWF serves as a carrier protein for factor VIII (FVIII), and also facilitates platelet adhesion through its interaction with platelet GPIb on the platelet surface and through its binding to the subendothelial matrix. This interaction is driven in vivo by shear stress, which induces a conformational change in VWF that allows it to bind platelet GPIb. In vitro, however, this interaction is induced by the antibiotic ristocetin, which enables VWF and platelet GPIb to interact in the absence of shear forces. Laboratory testing of VWF utilizes ristocetin in the VWF ristocetin cofactor activity assay (VWF:RCo), which is a measure of VWF binding to platelets, or by ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA).

A vetebral arch consists of (i) a pair of vertebral pedicles (FMA:11950), which are short thick processes that extend from the vertebral body to connect the body to the vertebral arch; (ii) a pari of vertebral laminae (broad plates that extending dorsally and medially from the pedicles fusing with one another to complete the roof of the vertebral arch); (iii) the spinous process (a process that is directed backward and downward from the junction of the laminae and to which muscles and ligaments attach); (iv) two superior articular processes and two inferior articular processes that articulate between two adjacent vertebrae); and (v) two transverse processes that extend at either side from the point where the lamina joins the pedicle, between the superior and inferior articular processes and allow the attachment of muscles and ligaments.

Pulsatile tinnitus may be associated with vascular abnormalities such as arterioevenous shunts or glomus tumors or the jugular vein, arterial bruits related to a high-riding carotid artery (close to the auditory areas) or carotid stenosis, or venous abnormalities such as a dehiscent jugular bulb or to hypertension. Finally, in some patients, mechanical abnormalities such a spatulous eustachian tubes, palatomyoclonus (small spasms of muscles in the soft palate area), or idiopathic stapedial muscle spasm may represent the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus."

def: "Congenital absence of the lumen of the larynx." [eMedicine:837630, HPO:probinson, pmid:17715321]
comment: Laryngeal atresia results from failure of recanalization of the laryngotracheal tube during the third month of gestation. Laryngeal atresia manifests as acute airway obstruction in the newborn immediately following clamping of the umbilical cord and is fatal without immediate airway management with a tracheotomy. Congenital laryngeal atresia is a rare anomaly that is mostly incompatible with life. Most authors claim that this malformation is related to an arrest of the sixth brachial arch at different gestational stages during normal embryologic development. Complete  laryngeal atresia results in a desperate emergency during the first few moments of life, and surgical intervention must occur within 2 to 5 minutes of birth to enable respiration. The most dramatic physical finding is that the child is aphonic, with absence of any cry or gasp at birth.

comment: Embryologically, the trachea and esophagus share a common lumen until they are separated by the development of the tracheoesophageal septum. Failure of this fusion and incomplete development of the tracheoesophageal septum may lead to congenital abnormalities such as isolatedlaryngeal cleft, tracheoesophageal fistula, and esophageal atresia, depending on the severity of the abnormality. Patients with laryngeal cleft may present with feeding difficulty, chronic cough, stridor, pneumonia or respiratory distress, depending on the size of the cleft.

def: "A decrease in the strength of the diaphragm." [HPO:probinson, pmid:2509822]
comment: Diaphragmatic paralysis is an extreme form of diaphragmatic weakness. Weakness of the diaphragm can result from abnormalities at any site along its neuromuscular axis, although it most frequently arises from diseases in the phrenic nerves or from myopathies affecting the diaphragm itself. Presence of diaphragmatic weakness may be suspected from the complaint of dyspnea (particularly on exertion) or orthopnea; or the presence of rapid, shallow breathing or, more importantly, paradoxical inward motion of the abdomen during inspiration on physical examination.

The technique for the thumb placement index is described in detail [Malina et al., 1973; Hall et al., 2007]. Briefly, the thumb placement index is the distance from the proximal crease of the index finger to the angle of the first interdigital space divided by the distance from the proximal crease of the index finger to the wrist flexion crease at the base of the thumb. This term should not be used with Preaxial polydactyly.

comment: This term differs from Partial absence of the finger because in that term, the phalanx must be missing, whereas in this term it may be small, but present. Distal phalangeal lengths can be assessed subjectively by comparing that digit segment to the rest of the digit, to other normal digits in that patient, or to typical patients of that age or build. Regarding the subjective definition, for individuals who do not have flexion creases, one may determine this by flexing the DIP joint and estimating the length of the terminal segment of the digit. Alternatively, one may be able to palpate the joint.

comment: This feature gives the appearance of a tall forehead, and may or may not include reduction of hair in the temporal areas. This can be distinguished from male pattern baldness as the hairline is the superior boundary of the muscular forehead, which can be actively wrinkled, in contrast to the scalp where no wrinkling can occur. In addition, texture of the skin of the scalp differs from the texture of the skin over the forehead.

comment: Short metacarpals can involve any of the metacarpal bones, and the affected ray should be specified. The assessment of isolated short metacarpal can be made by viewing the dorsum of the hand when clenched. Note that if metacarpals F2-5 are affected, the correct term is Short palm.

comment: Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981] but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively. The height of the vermilion of the lower lip varies considerably among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. If the lower lip vermilion is thin, the inferior border of the vermilion is less curved, and on a profile view, the lower lip vermilion is less convex than usual.

comment: The anterior third of the tongue is usually free or is partially attached to the floor of the mouth by the lingual frenulum. There is a spectrum ranging from fusion of the tongue to the floor of the mouth (ankyloglossia inferiorum) to a lingual frenulum that is short or anchored toward the tip of the tongue (sometimes called tongue tie). Ankyloglossia may be associated with a mild indentation of the tip of the tongue, which should not be coded as a Bifid tongue.

def: "A heterogeneous group of congenital spinal anomalies that result from defective closure of the neural tube early in fetal life." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Spinal dysraphism, or neural tube defect comprises a heterogeneous group of congenital spinal anomalies that result from defective closure of the neural tube early in fetal life and anomalous development of the caudal cell mass. The anatomic features common to the entire group is an anomaly in the midline structures of the back, especially the absence of some of the neural arches, and defects of the skin, filum terminale, nerves, and spinal cord. Open forms of spinal dysraphism include myelocele, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. These open forms are often associated with hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari malformation type II and may be classified as spina bifida aperta. Closed forms of spinal dysraphism includ spina bifida occulta.

During the embryologic development of the thyroid gland, the precursor of the thyroid migrates from the base of the tongue inferiorly though the thyroglossal duct. This duct normally disappears following the development and migration of the thyroid gland, but if a portion of the duct remain it can form a thyroglossal cyst.

[pmid:19125433]
comment: We have set an arguably arbitrary threshold to distinguish the object form the subjective finding. While severe degrees of cutaneous syndactyly are clearly objective, more subtle degrees are subjective. We set this threshold to distinguish these two situations. The digits (or parts of) are joined together by tissue that is not normally present between the digits at that point in the P/D axis. A modifier of "complete" may be used if the cutaneous syndactyly extends to the distal end of the nail bed of the digits. The affected digits should be specified. Note that the unqualified term "syndactyly" is no longer allowed as it is unclear whether this refers to bony or cutaneous syndactyly.

def: "Elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol levels." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol levels occur as the result of a deficiency of the enzyme delta-7-sterol reductase, the penultimate enzyme of mammalian sterol biosynthesis that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol. This enzyme removes the C(7-8) double bond introduced by the sterol delta8-delta7 isomerases. In addition, its role in drug-induced malformations is known: inhibitors of the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis such as AY9944 and BM15766 severely impair brain development. Homozygous mutations in the gene encoding for this enzyme are the molecular genetic cause of Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome.

name: Mirror image polydactyly
def: "A hand or foot with more than five digits that has a recognizable A/P axis of symmetry. The axis can lie within a normally formed or partially duplicated digit resembling a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe, or hallux. Alternatively, the axis can be in an interdigital space with a flanking pair of digits that resemble a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe or hallux. The most lateral digits on each side of the hand typically resemble fifth fingers/toes." [HPO:sdoelken, pmid:19125433]
comment: Transplantation of the ZPA (zone of polarised activity) to the anterior margin of a limb bud in the chick results in mirror image duplication of limb elements (Tabin, 1991). Similarly, mirror image duplication in the forelimb of the mouse has been observed with ectopic expression of Hox b-8 (Charit6 et al, 1994). Mirror hand anomaly in humans has been shown to be due to either aberrant positioning of the ZPA or altered inductive interactions of the Shh gene resulting in impairment of the mechanism responsible for the organization and differentiation of the limb bud, rather than a primary duplication event. In other words, the primary event results in failure of the radial ray to develop. The ulnar area will then induce the differentiation of two groups of ulnar rays. Timing of this insult could play a critical role in severity of this phenotypic feature. Syndromal mirror hand is probably due to agene mutation of the Shh gene (Hersh et al, 1995). Finally, the multiple hand deformity may be explained by true duplication of the ZPA.

def: "A type of congenital cataract in which the opacity follows the anterior or posterior Y suture." [HPO:probinson]
comment: During lens terminal differentiation, the originally cuboidal lens vesicle cells elongate into long fiber-like cells, or fibers. Y-shaped sutures form because of how the lens epithelial cells proliferate during formation. The Y sutures demarcate the boundaries between the lens cortex, which is peripheral to the Y sutures, and the lens nucleus, which is within and includes the Y sutures. The anterior Y suture is oriented upright, and the posterior Y suture is inverted.

def: "Blepharochalasis is characterized by recurrent, non-painful, nonerythematous episodes of eyelid edema. It has been divided into hypertrophic and atrophic forms. In the hypertrophic form recurrent edema results in orbital fat herniation through a weakened orbital septum. Most patients who have blepharochalasis present in an atrophic condition with atrophy of redundant eyelid skin and superior nasal fat pads." [PMID:3207663]
comment: Most patients who have blepharochalasis present in an atrophic condition with atrophy of redundant eyelid skin and superior nasal fat pads. Most of these atrophic patients do not go through a hypertrophic phase. Multiple attacks of eyelid edema result in thinning, stretching, and atrophy of eyelid tissues. The eyelid skin becomes redundant, discolored, and atrophic, appearing like wrinkled cigarette paper. The upper eyelids are more commonly affected, but the lower eyelids may also be involved. Blepharochalasis is not synonymous with dermatochalasis.

An attack usually begins with brief clonic movements of the orbicularis oculi and spreads over years to other facial muscles. Hemifacial spasm is often the result of chronic irritation of the facial nerve or nucleus.

comment: Afferent (seonsory) ataxia is caused by lackof proprioceptive feedback during gait and stance. It can be caused by lesions to the peripheral nerves, the dorsal root ganglia, or the spinal cord. It can be distinguished from cerebellar ataxia by (1) heavy dependence of the affected individual on visual guidance; (2) a minor degree of oculomotor deficits; and (3) the absence of dysarthria. Afferent ataxia may be associated with impaired tendon reflexes and sensory deficits.

The cysts may result from a lymphatic abnormality, possibly one caused by absent or inefficient connections between the lymphatic and venous systems. Depending on the site, the cut off may vary from site to site. Lowest would be 2.5 mm and highest 3.5 mm.

def: "The presence of an abnormally large hypoechoic space in the posterior fetal neck (usually detected on prenatal ultrasound examination)." [HPO:probinson, pmid:12751779]
comment: Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.

def: "A kind of nuclear cataract characterized by fiberglasslike or needlelike crystals projecting in different directions, through or close to the axial region of the lens." [HPO:probinson, pmid:9718335]
comment: This phenotype is characterized by fiberglasslike or needlelike crystals projecting in different directions, through or close to the axial region of the lens. Some crystals may be 11 mm in length, and their biochemical composition is not known. This type of cataract is considered to be different from the corraliform cataract, which does not show the needlelike projections. This opacity does not appear to respect the sutures or the direction of the lens fibers (Francois 1963) and appears to originate from the fetal and postnatal nuclei, suggesting a congenital origin with some postnatal progression, if any.

comment: A ventricular atrial diameter of more than 10 mm at 20-24 weeks of gestation has been accepted as defining ventriculomegaly because it represents at least 3 standard deviations above the mean (which is roughly 5 mm at 20-24 weeks of gestation). If the diameter is above 15 mm, the ventriculomegaly is considered to be severe.

def: "The presence of a supernumerary, i.e., extra, tooth or teeth." [HPO:ibailleulforestier]
comment: The most frequent supernumerary tooth is a mesiodens, which occurs between the two maxillary central incisors. Often it fails to erupt, but creates a large anterior diastema, and would not be detected on physical examination (requires X-ray evaluation). This designation excludes coexistence of primary and permanent dentition due to delayed loss of the former. Note that this term does not refer to the situation in which two rows of teeth are seen at the time of eruption of permanent dentition before exfoliation of primary teeth, which can be a normal finding.

comment: The prominence of the finger or toe pads varies throughout life, being greater in neonates and dependent on the state of hydration. This term should not be used if the digit has clubbing. Note that the synonym "fetal fingertip pads" should not be interpreted to mean that the prominent pad necessarily was present in this individual since fetal life. We do not endorse the use of the term "Persistent fetal pads" as this term implies knowledge of the natural history of this finding, which may or may not be known.

The "proximal" modifier specifies the loss of the proximal or middle phalanx with the nail still present and/or the radiographic finding of a remaining phalanx that is similar to a distal phalanx. It may be difficult to determine which phalanx is absent without x-rays and even then, there are circumstances where the missing bone may not be exactly identified (note that no attempt is made to distinguish missing middle from proximal phalanges). In this situation the location adjective will have to be removed. This finding is distinct from Short fingers.

def: "An abnormality of the function of the middle ear." [HPO:probinson]
comment: The middle ear comprises the tympanic cavity in the temporal bone of the skull behind the eardrum, and is separated from the outer ear by the ear drum. The tympanic cavity contains the auditory ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes) that vibrate when exposed to sound, forming a chain that extends to the oval window of the inner ear and whose main function is to amplify sound. Additionally, the middle ear connects to the back of the throat and nose through the Eustachian tube.

Corneal neovascularization may be a consequence of corneal hypoxia. Neovascular patterns can be separated into three clinical groups: deep neovascularization overlying Descemet's membrane (seen in herpetic and luetic interstitial keratitis), stromal neovascularization (as a result of stromal keratitis), and vascular pannus (from ocular surface disorders).

comment: The lesions are variable in size and location, and frequently follow the course of a major retinal vein. Epiretinal membranes are a common feature. In contrast to retinal capillary hemangiomas, cavernous hemangiomas lack prominent feeder vessels, intraretinal exudate, and surrounding subretinal fluid. Because the fundoscopic features are characteristic, diagnosis can generally be made based upon clinical appearance.

def: "A congenital anomaly with partitioning of the right atrium to form a triatrial heart caused by persistence of the right valve of the sinus venosus. Typically, the right atrial partition is due to exaggerated fetal eustachian and thebesian valves, which together form an incomplete septum across the lower part of the atrium. This septum may range from a reticulum to a substantial sheet of tissue." [DDD:dbrown, HPO:probinson, pmid:17948095]
comment: Cor triatriatum dexter is a Latin phrase meaning that the heart (cor) has three atria (triatriatum) whereby the 'third' atrium is on the right (dexter) side.

comment: In about 50% of Double orifice mitral valve (DOMV) cases, valvular function is normal, others present with stenosis or regurgitation. In most cases, a larger orifice is accompanied by a small eccentric accessory orifice, and some show duplicated mitral valves. Embryologically, the lesion results from abnormal leaflet fusion and persistence of the left part of the common atrio-ventricular canal.

comment: The normal aortic arch crosses the left mainstem bronchus and descends in the left paravertebral gutter. The coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses. The first branch of the aorta is normally the right brachiocephalic artery, then the left common carotid artery, then the left subclavian artery. Abnormal branching refers to any deviance from the norm of the origin or course of these branches or the proximal vertebral arteries.

comment: This feature is most often seen in the disease arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). ARVC is defined histologically by the presence of progressive replacement of right ventricular myocardium with adipose and fibrous tissue often confined to a triangle of dysplasia comprising the right ventricular inflow, outflow, and apex. While these pathologic abnormalities can result in functional and morphological right ventricular abnormalities, they also occur in the left ventricle, producing a DCM phenotype, or can be present in the absence of clinically detectable structural changes in either ventricle. For the purposes of this classification, ARVC is defined by the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (global or regional), with or without left ventricular disease, in the presence of histological evidence for the disease and/or electrocardiographic abnormalities in accordance with published criteria.

In some patients, LVNC is associated with left ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction, which can be transient in neonates." [pmid:17916581]
comment: Left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC), also known as spongy myocardium, is a distinct form of cardiomyopathy occurring in-utero when segments of spongy myocardium fail to transform into compact, mature musculature resulting in prominent myocardial trabeculae, deep intra-trabecular recesses, and decreased cardiac function. It has been proposed that LVNC results from arrest of the compaction process during the second month of embryological development.

def: "A teratoma within the heart. Most commonly, these tumors are detected in the pericardial cavity attached to the pulmonary artery and aorta. The tumour size within the heart varies from 2 to 9 cm in diameter, and intrapericardial tumors as large as 15 cm have been reported. Intracardiac tumors arise from the atrial or ventricular wall as nodular masses protruding into the cardiac chambers. Cardiac and pericardial teratomas are easily detected in the fetus and neonate by two-dimensional echocardiography as heterogeneous and encapsulated cystic masses. Histologically, cardiac teratomas contain multiple immature elements including epithelium, neuroglial tissue, thyroid, pancreas, smooth and skeletal muscle, cartilage and bone."

Decreased corneal sensation is associated with a decreased corneal reflex (HP:0008000); however, impairment of the corneal reflex can have other causes such as trigeminal nerve compression or a cerebellopontine angle lesion. Well known causes of decreased corneal sensation include Herpes simplex keratitis, neuroparalytic keratitis, leprosy, acoustic neuroma, and absolute glaucoma.

comment: The examiner can test for asterixis by asking the patient to extend the arms, spread the fingers, dorsiflex the wrist and observe for the abnormal "flapping" tremor at the wrist. Asterixis represents the failure to actively maintain a position and is caused by the abnormal function of diencephalic motor centers that regulate the tone of the agonist and antagonist muscles involved in maintaining posture.

comment: The protein C pathway is a major anticoagulant mechanism that down-regulates the prothrombin- and intrinsic factor X (FX)-activating complexes via inactivation of their respective cofactors, activated factors V (FVa) and VIII (FVIIIa). Cofactor inactivation occurs by limited proteolysis at certain amino acid positions in FVa  and in FVIIIa. These reactions are catalyzed by the serine protease activated protein C (APC) and stimulated by the APC cofactor protein S. Functional defects of the protein C pathway determine a plasma phenotype known as APC resistance, which is a prevalent and important risk factor for venous thrombosis. A plasma is termed 'APC resistant' when the addition of exogenous APC fails to prolong its clotting time in an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay.

comment: Renal clearance is defined as the volume of plasma per minute needed to excrete the quantity of a solute appearing in the urine in a minute. Normal values for adults are 97 to 137 ml/min (male) and 88 to 128 ml/min (female). This term refers to a reduction below normal limits in the ability of the kidney to clear creatinine from the bloodstream.

[HPO:probinson, pmid:19606528, pmid:20301301]
comment: Ciliated epithelial cells bear approximately 200 motile (9 + 2) cilia that move with both intracellular and intercellular synchrony. The pattern of beat in 9 + 2 motile cilia occurs in a waveform having a forward effective stroke followed by a return stroke. The direction of stroke is a function of the directional orientation of the central microtubules. In addition to moving in synchrony, individual cilia in normal cells are very plastic and move fluidly, sometimes deforming briefly upon encountering resistance and/or particles being transported over the mucosal surface. Cilia are embedded in a watery periciliary fluid of low viscosity, which facilitates the rapid beat cycle to move the more viscous overlying layer of mucus. Ciliary beat frequency ranges from approximately 8-20 Hz under normal conditions but may be accelerated by exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke.

Note that pubarche refers to the development of pubic hair, axillary hair, and adult sweat gland (apocrine) odor. The physical features associated with pubarche reflect the onset of adrenarche, which refers to the pubertal maturation of the adrenal and is associated with increased secretion of an adrenal hormone called dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS).

def: "Overgrowth of the choroid plexus." [HPO:probinson, pmid:16523225]
comment: The most common location for overgrowth is the lateral ventricles. The choroid plexus folds into many villi around capillaries, creating frond-like processes that project into the ventricles. The terms choroid plexus hypertrophy or choroid plexus hyperplasia are used interchangeably to refer to an increase in size of these structures. Diffuse villous hyperplasia of choroid plexus (DVHCP) is a rare condition which is characterized by the presence of diffuse enlargement of the entire choroid plexus throughout the length of the choroidal fissure and overproduction of CSF.

comment: The sphincter of Oddi (also known as sphincter of ampulla) is a muscular valve that controls the flow of bile and pancreatic juice through the ampulla of Vater into the second part of the duodenum. Increased tone of the sphincter or disturbance in the coordination of contraction of the biliary ducts prevents normal emptying of the biliary tree. This may result in biliary pain, common bile duct dilation and episodes of pancreatitis.

comment: Tetralogy of Fallot with Pulmonary Atresia (TOF/PA) is a complex lesion with many different anatomic variants. The primary source of variability in this lesion is in the anatomy of the pulmonary arteries, with the spectrum ranging from well-formed, confluent pulmonary artery branches to completely absent native pulmonary arteries and major aorto-pulmonary collaterals (MAPCA's) providing all the pulmonary blood flow. The majority of cases fall somewhere in between these two ends of the spectrum, with the total pulmonary blood flow provided by a combination of diminutive native pulmonary arteries and multiple MAPCA.

name: Skewed maternal X inactivation
def: "A deviation from equal (50%) inactivation of each parental X chromosome in maternal cells." [HPO:probinson, pmid:18097476]
comment: X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the process  by which one of the two copies of the X chromosome present in females is inactivated in order to achieves dosage equivalency for X-linked genes between XY males and XX females. An individual cell's decision to inactivate either the paternal or maternal X is made early in development, at approximately the time of implantation, such that normally there is a roughly equal distribution of either X being active. A deviation from equality is known as skewing, with common criteria for "skewed" inactivation being arbitrarily defined as the observation of inactivation of the same allele in 75% or 80% of cells (and very skewed inactivation resulting in 90% or 95% of cells with the same allele inactive). For some X-linked diseases there is strong selection in the heterozygous carrier in favor of cells bearing the mutation on the silenced inactive X, and thus, assessment of XCI skewing in female family members can be suggestive of carrier status.

def: "Lack of specific granules in neutrophils." [HPO:probinson, pmid:6155073]
comment: Neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) contain two principal types of granules. Azurophil granules appear early in neutrophil development and contain lysosomal enzymes, lysozyme, and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Specific granules are formed later, lack MPO and hydrolases, but contain lactoferrin and the remainder of the cell's complement of lysozyme. Consequently, specific granules may be conveniently detected at the electron-microscopic (EM) level by the cytochemical demonstration of their lack of MPO, while at the optical level their presence can be inferred from their positive immunocytochemical staining for lactoferrin with the use of specific antiserums.

def: "Deposition of fibrillar material that can be found on all anterior segment structures bathed by aqueous humor." [HPO:probinson, pmid:23157966]
comment: In the eye, pseudoexfoliation syndrome is characterized by the deposition of fibrillar material that can be found on all anterior segment structures bathed by aqueous humor. PXM can be observed in vivo during slit lamp examination. It appears as 'dandruff-like' material in the anterior chamber or most characteristically on the anterior lens capsule deposited in a double concentric ring pattern. The rings are separated by a clear zone presumably created because of the movement of the iris on the anterior lens surface. The central ring is located at the area of the iris sphincter, while the peripheral ring is only visible after pupil dilation. PXM is also often observed by slit lamp examination at the pupillary margin, on the lens zonules and on the trabecular meshwork. The site of production of this material which is a complex of various glycoproteins is unclear, but PXM can potentially originate from the iris, lens epithelium, ciliary body, or the trabecular meshwork.

comment: The female reproductive tract primarily develops from the M??llerian ducts (MD), which form as an invagination of the coelomic epithelium and further develop into the upper two-thirds of the vagina, the uterus and the Fallopian tubes. Complete aplasia of the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina is termed Mullerian aplasia. This term refers to the aplasia of the upper roughly two thirds of the vagina that is characteristic of Mullerian aplasia.

name: Elevated brain choline level by MRS
def: "An increase in the level of choline-containing compounds in the brain identified by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)." [UToronto:htrang]
comment: The Choline (Cho) peak is a heterogeneous peak representing various choline-containing compounds such as acetylcholine, phosphocholine (lecithin), glycerophosphocholine, and various other intermediates of phospholipids metabolism. It is an indicator of cell density and cell wall turnover. Elevated levels are found in tumors, especially malignant ones, and in certain demyelinating diseases. Choline resonance presents at 3.22 ppm. Studies have shown there is also a direct association between Cho and levels of Ki-67, a protein expressed in all phases of the cell cycle except GO that serves as a good marker for cellular proliferation. This observation makes Cho a reliable predictor of cellular activity in tumor tissue.

comment: Lactate (Lac) is absent in normal brain tissue and its presence is indicative of anerobic glycolysis at the cellular level. Elevated levels are associated with ischemic conditions or metabolic disorders (where anerobic glycolysis predominates) but is also noted at the edges of large brain tumours. The peak is very sensitive to the technique employed and unless the correct echo time is employed, it may be artifactually suppressed. The spectral peak lies at 1:33 ppm. The peak is often inverted or bifid.

def: "A decrease in the level of N-acetyl aspartate in the brain identified by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)." [UToronto:htrang]
comment: N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA) is an amino acid found exclusively in neurons. It is regarded as a non-specific marker and is thought to be involved in Coenzyme A interactions and lipogenesis within the brain. It is a marker of neuronal viability. Normal NAA concentration is in the range of 8-9 mmol/kg in healthy adult brain. Concentrations are decreased in conditions leading to axonal injury or neuronal loss. NAA is also decreased in other conditions such as neoplasm, infarction, and inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis. NAA peak is seen at 2.0 ppm (parts per million) on MR spectra.

comment: Creatine (Cr) is related to cell energy pathways, being both the substrate and product of creatine kinase. Creatine reflects the energy potential available in brain tissue. Its concentration in normal brain remains very high and stable due to high metabolic energy needs of brain cells. Its peak is noticed at 3.0 ppm. Creatine-Choline ratios are an important indicator of disease states such as demyelization.

A lesion is commonly seen with a multilobulated, "mulberry" appearance, but can also appear flat and semitranslucent. It is most frequently associated with tuberous sclerosis but may also be found rarely in patients with neurofibromatosis. Although the finding may point toward a systemic association, it can also be found incidentally on retinal examination as an isolated presentation.

def: "A type of cardiomyopathy characterized anatomically by deep trabeculations in the ventricular wall, which define recesses communicating with the main ventricular chamber." [HPO:probinson, pmid:15210614, pmid:24282766]
comment: Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium is a cardiomyopathy thought to be caused by arrest of normal embryogenesis of the endocardium and myocardium. This abnormality is often associated with other congenital cardiac defects, but it is also seen in the absence of other cardiac anomalies. During early embryonic development, the myocardium is a loose network of interwoven fibers separated by deep recesses that link the myocardium with the left ventricular cavity. Gradual compaction of this spongy meshwork of fibers and intertrabecular recesses, or sinusoids, occurs between weeks 5 and 8 of embryonic life, proceeding from the epicardium to endocardium and from the base of the heart to the apex. Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is an uncommon finding. It is thought to be caused by arrest of the normal process of endomyocardial morphogenesis. The left ventricle is uniformly affected, but biventricular noncompaction has been reported, with right ventricular noncompaction described in less than one-half of patients. Because of difficulty in distinguishing normal variants in the highly trabeculated right ventricle from the pathological noncompacted ventricle, several authors dispute the existence of right ventricular noncompaction [pmid:15210614].

comment: Myocarditis can be caused by a variety of bacterial and viral infections. Enteroviruses, especially coxsackievirus B, are often associated with acute myocarditis. \nHowever, with the advent of genetic analysis, adenovirus and parvovirus B19 have also been found to be frequent causes of myocarditis. Exposure to drug treatment, physical stimuli such as radiation and heat, metabolic disorders, immune disorders, and pregnancy are also causes of myocarditis. Many cases of myocarditis are idiopathic. Myocarditis presents with non-specific symptoms including chest pain, dyspnoea, and palpitations, and thus often mimics more common disorders such as coronary artery disease. In some patients, cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsy can help identify myocarditis, predict risk of cardiovascular events, and guide treatment.

Endometriosis affects 6 to 10% of women of reproductive age, 50 to 60% of women and teenage girls with pelvic pain, and up to 50% of women with infertility. Peritoneal disease, which is dependent on estrogen for growth, derives from retrograde menstruation of steroid hormone???sensitive endometrial cells and tissues, which implant on peritoneal surfaces and elicit an inflammatory response. This response is accompanied by angiogenesis, adhesions, fibrosis, scarring, neuronal infiltration, and anatomical distortion resulting in pain and infertility.

If the toe gait persists for 2-3 years, this gait pattern is not considered to be habitual. Therefore, the judgment of habitual toe gait should not be determined without evaluation for other diseases.

comment: Ependymoblastoma is a rare tumor that occurs in infants and young children in the first two years of life. Both sexes are affected equally. Patients present with signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus. Focal neurological signs may be present in older children. On MRI, ependymoblastomas are large heterogeneously enhancing lesion with associated brain edema and mass effect. Ependymoblastomas are well-circumscribed lesions, with a distinct margin between tumor and normal brain, though focal microscopic extension and leptomeningeal invasion are common. Histologically, an ependymoblastoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumor with tumor cell arranged in multilayered rosettes consisting of an outer rim of tumor cells merging with the surrounding undifferentiated neuroectodermal cells. The tumor cells are immunopositive for S100, vimentin, cytokeratin and GFAP, and show high mitotic activity.

alt_id: HP:0030013
def: "The growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus." [HPO:probinson, pmid:25221341]
comment: The main manifestations of endometriosis are chronic upper abdominal pain and infertility. Endometriosis occurs primarily on the pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, and rectovaginal septum, and in rare cases on the diaphragm, pleura, and pericardium. Endometriosis affects 6 to 10% of women of reproductive age, 50 to 60% of women and teenage girls with pelvic pain, and up to 50% of women with infertility. Peritoneal disease, which is dependent on estrogen for growth, derives from retrograde menstruation of steroid hormone sensitive endometrial cells and tissues, which implant on peritoneal surfaces and elicit an inflammatory response. This response is accompanied by angiogenesis, adhesions, fibrosis, scarring, neuronal infiltration, and anatomical distortion resulting in pain and infertility.

def: "Mislocalised thyroid gland." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: An aberrant or ectopic thyroid gland may occur anywhere along the path of initial descent of the thyroid. A total failure to descend contrasts with the incomplete descent of the thyroid, in which case the resulting final resting point of the gland may be high in the neck or just below the hyoid bone. Appart from an abnormal descent, accessory thyroid tissue can also occur, arising from remnants of the thyroglossal duct anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct tract.

def: "A tic is a sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor movement or vocalization involving discrete muscle groups." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Tics can be invisible to the observer, such as abdominal tensing or toe crunching. Common motor and phonic tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing. Movements of other movement disorders (for example, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus) must be distinguished from tics. Other conditions, such as autism and stereotypic movement disorder, also include movements which may be confused with tics. Tics must also be distinguished from the compulsions of OCD and from seizure activity. Tics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, boredom, or high-energy emotions, which can include negative emotions, such as anxiety, but positive emotions as well, such as excitement or anticipation. Relaxation may result in a tic increase (for instance, watching television or using a computer), while concentration on an absorbing activity often leads to a decrease in tics.

comment: Typical sites of involvement are the axillary margins of the scapula, ribs, pubic rami, proximal ends of the femur and ulna. On x-rays pseudo-fractures appear as a lucent line about 1 -2 cm wide, vertical to the cortex and are pathognomonic of osteomalacia, seen on the concave side and are also seen in Paget disease on the convex side of the bone.

comment: A sarcoma (from the Greek sarx meaning flesh) is a general term describing a malignant neoplasm, or cancer, that arises from transformed connective tissue cells such as bone, cartilage and fat cells, which originate from embryonic mesoderm. This is in contrast to carcinomas, which are of epithelial origin (breast, colon, pancreas, and others). However, due to an evolving understanding of tissue origin, the term sarcoma is sometimes applied to tumors now known to arise from epithelial tissue. The term soft tissue sarcoma is used to describe tumors of soft tissue, which includes elements that are in connective tissue, but not derived from it (such as muscles and blood vessels).

Histologically they resemble low-grade fibrosarcomas, but they are very locally aggressive and tend to recur even after complete resection. There is a tendency for recurrence in the setting of prior surgery and the most common localisation of these tumors is intraabdominal from smooth muscle cells of the instestine." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Most cases are sporadic, but some are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Approximately 10% of individuals with Gardner's syndrome, a type of FAP with extracolonic features, have desmoid tumors.\nRisk factors for desmoid disease amongst FAP patients include female gender, a 3' APC mutation, a positive family history and a history of previous abdominal surgery.

def: "A contraction of the diaphragm that repeats several times per minute. In humans, the abrupt rush of air into the lungs causes the epiglottis to close, creating a hic sound.

The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies claim to shorten the duration, and medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups. Hiccups are caused by many central and peripheral nervous system disorders, all from injury or irritation to the phrenic and vagus nerves, as well as toxic or metabolic disorders affecting the aforementioned systems. Hiccups often occur after consuming carbonated beverages, alcohol, dry breads, or spicy foods. Prolonged laughter or eating too fast are also known to cause hiccups. Persistent or intractable hiccups may be caused by any condition which irritates or damages the relevant nerves.

They are continuous and random and can involve proximal and/or distal muscles on one side of the body, while some cases even include the facial muscles. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Hemiballismus is a very rare movement disorder. It is five hundred times rarer than Parkinson disease. Its effects can sometimes be severe enough to prevent patients from being able to perform daily functions. It is usually associated with structural brain lesions but can occur with metabolic abnormalities. The symptoms can also decrease while the patient is asleep, unlike some movement disorders.

comment: Senile plaques can be found in human and animal brains. From an age of 60 years (10%) to an age of 80 years (60%) the proportion of people with plaques increases approximately linearly. A small number of plaques can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have plaques than males. The plaques occur commonly in the amygdoid nucleus and the sulci of the cortex of brain. The deposits are associated with degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes. Large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimers disease, and some of the abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles. In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides. These polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic.

Tendons are similar to ligaments and fascia as they are all made of collagen except that ligaments join one bone to another bone, and fascia connect muscles to other muscles. Tendons and muscles work together and can only exert a pulling force.

This aberrant innervation leads to uncontrollable tearing while eating or in anticipation of a meal." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: The aberrant innervation leading to this phenomenon may be seen for example as a hereditary trait in some patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome in which case it may occur unilateral or bilateral, but it may also result from a secondary aberrant reinnervation following a peripheral facial palsy, in which case it is associated with uncontrollable ipsilateral tearing. In the past gustatory lacrimation was considered to be a very rare non-hereditary type of anomalous, cranial nerve-end organ innervation but rare occurences in patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome have shown, that this feature may also appear as a hereditary condition.

comment: Note that some restrict the use of the term to inability to extend the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth finger. We do not restrict the term in this way. This term should not be used if the patient has Clenched hand. A similar effect can be created by radial angulation within the distal phalanx with thickening of the epiphysis, which is called Kirner deformity or dystelephalangy. The affected digits should be specified.

The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. Angioedema is similar to urticaria, but the swelling is subcutaneous rather than on the epidermis." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Apart from the common form, mediated by allergy, it has been reported as a side effect of some medications, in particular ACE inhibitors. Additionally, there are three autosomal dominant inherited forms known, due to mutations in the genes that control the clotting cascade, including the SERPING1 gene, which results in deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor (type I HAE) and the F12 gene, which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term 'hereditary angioneurotic edema' (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.

In most cases, the duplication is located in the lower thrid of the esophagus, and the most common associated symptom is difficulty in swallowing. Esophageal duplication occurs because of maldevelopment of the posterior division of embryonic foregut.

In a study by Mullaji et al to determine tibial torsion norms, individuals in India were found to have less tibial torsion than Caucasians but about the same amount as the Japanese population. The differences in normal tibial torsion values are expected to be caused by the different lifestyles and postures of the different populations, such as cross-legged sitting positions.

def: "A mental disorder characterized by a disintegration of thought processes and of emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3-0.7%." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations (especially of voices), are common, and any Schneiderian first-rank symptoms are particularly indicative of the illness. Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, impairment of ego boundaries, and loss of energy and initiative. Schizophrenia is diagnosed only if symptoms persist for at least one month. The illness can spontaneously remit, run a course with infrequent or frequent relapses, or become chronic. The prognosis has improved with antipsychotic drugs and with vigorous psychological and social management and rehabilitation. The many causes include genetic factors, environmental stress, and various triggering factors.

comment: This may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. The prime cause of gangrene is reduced blood supply to the affected tissues, which results in cell death. Diabetes and long-term smoking increase the risk of suffering from gangrene. There are different types of gangrene with different symptoms, such as dry gangrene, wet gangrene, gas gangrene, internal gangrene and necrotising fasciitis. Treatment options include debridement (or, in severe cases, amputation) of the affected body parts, antibiotics, vascular surgery, maggot therapy or hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

def: "Connective tissue nevi are hamartomas in which one or several components of the dermis is altered." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Lesions in which collagen predominates are called collagenomas; lesions in which elastin predominates are called elastomas. A nevus mucinosis is a lesion in which an alteration in the amount of dermal glycosaminoglycan is present. The name nevus mucinosis is also used for lesions in which an alteration in more than one dermal component is present. Connective tissue nevi may be solitary or multiple, sporadic or inherited. They may occur as isolated skin lesions, or they may be associated with a number of syndromes.
