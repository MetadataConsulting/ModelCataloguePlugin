h1. r:stash Tag

Using this tag you can write "inline" content anywhere in your GSP (providing you use Sitemesh layouts) and place into any disposition.

Corresponding [layoutResources|tags] can write these out.

This mechanism is used internally for inline [script|tags] invocations.

Currently only @script@ and @style@ types are supported.

          .ugly-inline-style { border: none; }
       </r:stash>

       <r:stash type="script" disposition="middle">
          window.alert('This is same as r:script with disposition="middle"'');
       </r:stash>
   </body>
