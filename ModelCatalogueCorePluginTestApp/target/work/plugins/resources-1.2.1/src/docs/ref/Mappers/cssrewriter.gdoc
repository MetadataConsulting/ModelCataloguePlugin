h1. cssrewriter mapper

The "cssrewriter" is the second phase of CSS rewriting.

It seeks out urls in the CSS resources that are prefixed with "resource:" having been previously processed by [csspreprocessor|Mappers], and then converts them to the new final URL of the resource.

For example if the target resource, an image, has moved and been renamed, the new URL written to the CSS will reflect this.
