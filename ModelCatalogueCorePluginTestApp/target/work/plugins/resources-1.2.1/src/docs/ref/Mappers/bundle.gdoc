h1. bundle mapper

The "bundle" mapper adds together resources of the same type to reduce the number of files your client pages request.

The "bundle" mapper looks at the value of the "bundle" property on resources and if found, will add the resource to a new synthetic aggregated resource. 

This aggregated resource is itself processed through mappers, so it is subject to the other optimisations you apply to the kind of resource the bundle is aggregating.

Bundles are always in the base directory of the static resources folder - which means references to files inside the bundle must be re-adjusted so they continue to refer to the same files. This is made possible for CSS files by the [csspreprocessor|Mappers] and [cssrewriter|Mappers] mappers.
