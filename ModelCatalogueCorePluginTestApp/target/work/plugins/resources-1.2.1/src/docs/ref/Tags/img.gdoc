h1. r:img Tag

This tag renders an HTML <img> tag that points to a declared or undeclared resource.

h2. Attributes

* uri - Optional. The app-relative URI of the resource, i.e. "/images/icon.png". Used as an alternative to dir/file combination
* file - Optional. The file attribute as used by g:resource
* dir - Optional. The dir attribute as used by g:resource. Defaults to "images"
* plugin - Optional. The plugin attribute as used by g:resource

All other attributes such as width and height are passed-through. Note that if the resource is declared and has 'attrs' specified, these will be passed through. Therefore you can declare images in modules and use that as a central location for their common attributes such as width and height.
