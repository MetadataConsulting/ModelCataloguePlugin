h1. r:resource Tag

This tag returns the URL to use link to a resource. The regular g:resource links directly to unprocessed resources (prior to Grails 1.4), and r:resource links to processed resources.

In Grails 1.4 and higher, g:resource will delegate to r:resource automatically.

You will rarely need to call this tag, perhaps only when building URLs to pass to other pieces of server-side code or as a variable to JS code.
