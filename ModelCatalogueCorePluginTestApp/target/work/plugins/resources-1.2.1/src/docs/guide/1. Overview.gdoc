This plugin provides the Resources framework for Grails.

The issues that the Resources framework tackles are:

* Web application performance tuning is difficult
* Correct load order for resources that depend on others
* Deferring inclusion of JavaScript to the end of the document
* The need for a standard way to for Grails plugins to expose static resources
* The need for an extensible processing chain to optimize resources
* Preventing inclusion of the same resource multiple times
* The need for identical behaviour in development and production

The Resources plugin achieves these goals by introducing new artefacts and processing the resources using the server's local file system.

In tandem with Sitemesh layouts and the Grails plugin dependency system, you gain the ability to express dependencies on specific UI libraries, and the ability to specify the resources that a page needs anywhere in the page GSPs or even in rendered GSP templates.

The Resource framework tags confer a whole new level of abstraction and power to application and plugin developers. It makes possible new patterns for managing resources and smart handling of JavaScript and CSS code.

It adds artefacts for declaring resources, for declaring "mappers" that can process resources, and a servlet filter to serve processed resources.
