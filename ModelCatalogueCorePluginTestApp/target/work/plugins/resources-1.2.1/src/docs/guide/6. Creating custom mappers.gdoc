The resource processing chain uses ResourceMapper artefacts to do the work.

You can create your own ResourceMapper artefacts inside your application or plugins to perform tasks such as;

* Moving and renaming resources
* Changing the contents of resource files (compress, minify, compile etc)
* Set HTTP response headers when requests are processed

Resource mappers only get the chance to map (process) each resource once - the final resource is then stored on disk to serve future requests.
