To declare that a module depends on another, you use dependsOn. It accepts a string or list of names. The string can be comma-delimited to specify multiple dependencies. You can also call dependsOn as many times as you like:

{code:java}
modules = {
    core {
        dependsOn 'jquery, utils'
        dependsOn 'other'
        dependsOn(['heavy', 'metal'])
    }
}
{code}
