Installing the "cached-resources" and "zipped-resources" plugins and running your app again, you will then find that your resources are cached in the browser "eternally" and transferred with zip encoding.

Simply run these commands:

{code}
grails install-plugin zipped-resources
grails install-plugin cached-resources
{code}

No code changes are necessary for the simple use case.

For details of these plugins please see the documentation for [zipped-resources|http://grails.org/plugin/zipped-resources] and [cached-resources|http://grails.org/plugin/cached-resources].

More resources-aware plugins will be released. You can search by tag "resources" on the Grails portal with [this link|http://grails.org/search?q=tag%3Aresources].
