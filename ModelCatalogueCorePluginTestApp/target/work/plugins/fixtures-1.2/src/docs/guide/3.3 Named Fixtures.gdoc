A fixture can be loaded with a name, which allows the same fixture to be referenced via the same name later on.

{code}
// load it and name it 'myFixture'
fixtureLoader['myFixture'].load('someFixtureFile')
// access it
fixtureLoader['myFixture'].someObjectFromTheFixture
{code}

Property access notation also works...

{code}
// load it and name it 'myFixture'
fixtureLoader.myFixture.load('someFixtureFile')
// access it
fixtureLoader.myFixture.someObjectFromTheFixture
{code}
