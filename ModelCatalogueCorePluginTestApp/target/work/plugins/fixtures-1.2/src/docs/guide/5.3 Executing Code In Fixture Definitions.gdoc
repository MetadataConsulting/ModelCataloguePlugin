You may need to execute a piece of code in a fixture definition. The most common use case for this is encoding some piece of data, e.g. a password.

Any bean defined in your application can be accessed by name...

{code}
fixtureLoader.load {
    user(User) {
        username = 'username'
        password = passwordEncodingService.encode('password')
    }
}
{code}

In this example, @passwordEncodingService@ is a service defined in the application.
