Fixture files can include other fixture files via the @include()@ method that takes one or more file patterns like the @fixtureLoader.load()@ method.

{code}
include "authors"

fixture {
  gina(Book, title: "Groovy In Action", authors: [guillaume, dierk])
}
{code}

This will cause the @authors@ fixtures file to be _executed_ and _merged_ into the current fixture.
