Fixture files can load other fixture files as _parents_ via the @load()@ method that takes one or more file patterns like the @fixtureLoader.load()@ method.

{code}
load "authors"

fixture {
  gina(Book, title: "Groovy In Action", authors: [guillaume, dierk])
}
{code}

This will cause the @authors@ fixtures file to be _executed_ and _loaded_\, with it then being the parent of the fixture defined in the file. In other words, the objects in the _inner_ fixture (@authors@ in this example) are instantiated and saved at the point where the @load()@ call occurs.

The @load()@ method in a fixture file can also define a fixture inline, which has the same effect.

{code}
load { 
  guillaume(Author, name: "Guillaume Laforge")
  dierk(Author, name: "Dierk Koenig")
}

fixture {
  gina(Book, title: "Groovy In Action", authors: [guillaume, dierk])
}
{code}
