Many Grails projects are private applications and the only "publication" of those applications involves deploying the generated WAR file to a servlet container like Tomcat. But sometimes, particularly in the case of plugins, you want to share the project's WAR, zip or JAR. That's where the Release plugin comes in.

Once this plugin is installed, you can immediately start publishing your artifacts to Maven-compatible repositories. In the case of plugins, you can also publish them to Subversion-based repositories such as the Grails Central Plugin Repository. This user guide will show you exactly what you need to do.
