= Environment

== Database

Model Catalogue is currently tested and deployed against *MySQL* database server with InnoDB
storage engine. The application was tested with versions `5.6.x` and `5.7.x`. The database
schema is created automatically yet if the database is created automatically following
indexes are not present but highly recommended:

[source,SQL]
----
CREATE INDEX change_idx_1 ON `change` (changed_id, system, undone, parent_id, type, date_created);
CREATE INDEX change_idx_2 ON `change` (parent_id, system, other_side, changed_id);
CREATE INDEX change_idx_3 ON `change` (author_id, other_side, system, date_created);
----

The expected load are lower tens of users so the CPU and memory can be rather small (`db.t2.micro` or `db.t2.micro`
equivalent). Average database can take consume about 2 GB of disk space.

Daily backups are expected to enabled for the database.

== Search

Model Catalogue uses *Elasticsearch* server as a search engine. Currently the version `2.3.5` is in use and
should be compatible to any newer release in `2.3.x` but not with the newer ones. The version
of the server should correspond the drivers used by the application. The best way to achieve this is to use
https://hub.docker.com/r/metadata/registry-elasticsearch/[metadata/registry-elasticsearch] Docker image which is
guaranteed to be synchronized with the main application image https://hub.docker.com/r/metadata/registry/[metadata/registry]
and expected Elasticsearch settings.

The search indicies can be rebuild from the database yet the docker container should be run with `-v /path/to/es/backup:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data`
to retain the indicies between the potential container restarts and upgrades.

When the main application is not running on the same docker engine then the port `9300` needs to be published with `-p 9300:9300`.

To achieve the best performance 4 GB of system memory is recommended. You can achieve this by running the container with
`--memory="4g" -e ES_HEAP_SIZE=2g` parameters.

See https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-make-a-dockerfile-for-elasticsearch[How to Make a Dockerfile for Elasticsearch] for
further information.

Here's the summary of recommended `docker run` parameters (the port setting is omited as running within the same engine is recommended):

----
docker run -d --restart="always" --name=mc-es -v "$PWD/esdata":/usr/share/elasticsearch/data --memory="4g" -e ES_HEAP_SIZE=2g metadata/registry-elasticsearch:2
----

== Application

Model Catalogue is Java web application running on Tomcat 8 and JDK 8. It is distributed as Docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/metadata/registry/[metadata/registry]
which contains the application deployed as ROOT application and the link:production.adoc[Model Catalogue configuration file]
enabled to get important configuration from the environmental variables. You can find reference of all the environmental variables at the end of this section.

The average memory consumption of the application is under 2 GB but some of the processes such as search reindexing or
some of the reports may require more memory to run. Because of this the recommended memory setting for production environment is 8 GB.

CPU consumption is usually low.

The application can store Assets (blob files) in database (not recommended), file system (needs additional backup settings)
or to Amazon S3 (preferred).

Mail server configuration is needed to enable user self-registration and sending forgotten password.

Users can log in with their Google accounts if Google API key and secret is set.

As the number of environmental variable is high the best way how to supply it to the docker command is with environment file `--env-file mc.env`. The file
contains variable declaration in `ENV_VAR=value` format on each line.

For most secure communication with the Elasticsearch server run the Elasticsearch container within the same docker engine and link it with `--link mc-es:mc-es`.

----
docker run -d --restart="always" --name=mc --env-file mc.env metadata/registry:2
