# Running on Amazon Web Services

As Model Catalogue is shipped as Docker image it can be easily run using
[Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=eu-west-1).


## Setup

### Amazon S3
You need a Amazon S3 bucket to store assets into.

### Amazon RSD
You need one `db.t2.small` MySQL instance running. The security group
must allow inbound connections from the ECS registered instance (see bellow).

### ECS Cluster
You need _Cluster_ available with enough registered
container instances. There is _Cluster_ called _default_ always available
but it's recommended to create new cluster fo reach server. 
You need to start new Amazon ESC container instance for it if not
set up yet. Follow the guide here: [Amazon ECS Container Instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_instances.html).
The instance should be `m3.xlarge` to allow running Model Catalogue with
enough memory. Don't forget to assign the cluster name to the newly created instance as described in the step _10_.
If you've setup the instance properly it should appear
at _Clusters_ / _ESC Instances_ table.

### Task Definitions
Task definition are quite similar to `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` files.
They specify the containers to be run with some additional settings such as
environmental variables. You need two task definitions:

  1. Model Catalogue container based on [metadata/registry-elasticsearch](https://hub.docker.com/r/metadata/registry/)
  2. Elasticsearch container based on [metadata/registry-elasticsearch](https://hub.docker.com/r/metadata/registry-elasticsearch/)

You can easily create new _Task Definition_ using following JSON definition
if you go to _Task Definitions_ / _Crate new Task Definition / _Configure via JSON_.

            "name": "mc-es-data"
        }
    ],
    "family": "your-mc-all-task-definition"
}
```

You need to update the _Task Definition Name_ after saving the
JSON configuration to something more meaningful than `your-mc-all-task-definition-name`
and click `create`.

You need to update environmental variables to reflect your own settings
such as mail server, database host and credentials or catalogue URL.
See the [environmental variables description](environment.adoc)

The Elasticsearch indicies are considered ephemeral yet they are persisted
 in separate volume `/opt/docker-volumes/mc-es-data` between container
 restarts. If the indicies are lost they can always be recreated using
 `Reindex Catalogue` admin action of the Model Catalogue from the data
 stored in the database.

### Services
When you have your _Task Definition_ ready you can _Create_ new service
based on it. Call it for example `mc` and set the minimal tasks number
to one.

## Model Catalogue Upgrade
There are several way how to keep your Model Catalogue up to date.
One of them is to always point to specific version such e.g.
`metadata/registry:2.0.0-beta-10` instead of just `metadata/registry:2`
in your task definition. If you want to update to newer version then
create new _Task Definition Revision_ change the version tag and restart
the service with the new revision as described bellow.

If you want to use the latest `metadata/registry:2` then you have to
SSH into the container instance and pull the latest version manually.

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ec2containers.pem ec2-user@ec2-1-2-3-4.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
docker pull metadata/registry:2
```

Restart the service using following steps:

  1. Update the Model Catalogue service (`mc` in previous example) and set the number of tasks required to `0`
  2. Wait until the task is stopped
  3. Update the Model Catalogue service (`mc` in previous example) and set the number of tasks required to `1`
