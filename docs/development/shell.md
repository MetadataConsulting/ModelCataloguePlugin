# Shell Scripts

All the scripts which were located directly inside the ModelCataloguePlugin root project folder are being step by step migrated under the `bin` directory. When finished there should be only one Model Catalogue specific script - `./catalogue`. In most of use cases you just have to prefix the call with `./catalogue.`

Examples:

```shell
./catalogue run dev
./catalogue run prod
./catalogue test all
./catalogue clean
```
