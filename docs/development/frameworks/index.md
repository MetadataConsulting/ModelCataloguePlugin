* [Angular File Saver](https://github.com/alferov/angular-file-saver) for storing content to the client
* [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) ([ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/)) for event handling (waiting for wider adoption through codebase)
* [Rx Angular](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/rx.angular.js/) as a bridge between AngularJS and RxJS
* [STOMP](http://jmesnil.net/stomp-websocket/doc/) over [SockJS](http://sockjs.org) for server push notification
